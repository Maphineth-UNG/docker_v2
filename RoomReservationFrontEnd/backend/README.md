# EMSE Notes App Backend API

This is a RESTful API for managing notes and tasks. Notes can have multiple associated tasks, and each task belongs to a specific note. The API provides endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete notes and tasks.

## Database

The server uses an SQLite database located in the same directory as the server file. To reset the database with pristine tables, use the following command:

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

This command deletes the current database file (if it exists) and creates a new one with empty notes and tasks tables.


## Error Handling

The API returns `400 Bad Request` for validation errors, `404 Not Found` for missing resources, and `500 Internal Server Error` for unexpected server issues.

#### Example 400 Error Response:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid status. Allowed values are 'urgent', 'serious', or 'unimportant'."
}
```
